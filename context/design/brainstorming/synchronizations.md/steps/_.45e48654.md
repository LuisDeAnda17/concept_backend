# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

```
__concept:__ UserAuthentication
__purpose:__ Limit access of account to known users
__principle:__ after a user registers with a username and a password,
they can authenticate with that same username and password
and be treated each time as the same user
__state:__
>   - a set of Users with
        - a username String
        - a password String
__actions:__
    - __register__ (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
        - requires: A username and password of which neither has been taken before
        - effects: A new User is created with the same username and password
    - __authenticate__ (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
        - requires: the username and password both correspond to the same, existing User
        - effects: The User is allowed to enter
```
