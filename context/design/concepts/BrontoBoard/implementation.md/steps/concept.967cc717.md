# concept: BrontoBoard

## purpose

Manages a structured academic board for a user, comprising classes, assignments, and office hours, enabling organization and tracking of educational content.

## principle

A user initializes a BrontoBoard, then creates classes within it. For each class, they can add and manage assignments with due dates and schedule office hours. The system ensures each item (assignment, office hours, class) belongs to a single parent (class, class, BrontoBoard respectively) and maintains its properties.
