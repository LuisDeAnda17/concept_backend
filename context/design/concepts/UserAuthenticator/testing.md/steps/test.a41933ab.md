## trace:

```
Trace for UserAuthenticationConcept's Principle: "after a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated each time as the same user."

**Scenario:** Alice attempts to register and authenticate.

1.  **Action: UserAuthentication.register**
    *   **Input:** `username: "alice"`, `password: "alicePassword"`
    *   **Preconditions:** `username` "alice" is not taken.
    *   **Effects:** A new user document is created in the `users` collection with `_id` (e.g., "user:123"), `username: "alice"`, a securely `hashedPassword`, and a unique `salt`.
    *   **Output:** `{ user: "user:123" }`
    *   **Console Output:** `Trace: Alice registered with ID: user:123`

2.  **Action: UserAuthentication.authenticate** (First successful attempt)
    *   **Input:** `username: "alice"`, `password: "alicePassword"`
    *   **Preconditions:** A user with `username: "alice"` exists. The provided `password` matches the stored `hashedPassword` after salting.
    *   **Effects:** No state change.
    *   **Output:** `{ user: "user:123" }`
    *   **Console Output:** `Trace: Alice authenticated successfully (1st attempt).`

3.  **Action: UserAuthentication.authenticate** (Failed attempt with wrong password)
    *   **Input:** `username: "alice"`, `password: "incorrectPassword"`
    *   **Preconditions:** A user with `username: "alice"` exists. The provided `password` *does not* match the stored `hashedPassword` after salting.
    *   **Effects:** No state change.
    *   **Output:** `{ error: "Invalid username or password." }`
    *   **Console Output:** `Trace: Alice failed authentication with incorrect password.`

4.  **Action: UserAuthentication.authenticate** (Second successful attempt)
    *   **Input:** `username: "alice"`, `password: "alicePassword"`
    *   **Preconditions:** A user with `username: "alice"` exists. The provided `password` matches the stored `hashedPassword` after salting.
    *   **Effects:** No state change.
    *   **Output:** `{ user: "user:123" }`
    *   **Console Output:** `Trace: Alice authenticated successfully (2nd attempt).`
    *   **Verification:** The user ID returned ("user:123") is the same as the one returned during registration and the first successful authentication. This confirms that Alice is consistently recognized as the same user, fulfilling the principle.
    *   **Console Output:** `Trace: Principle fulfilled - Alice is consistently treated as the same user.`
