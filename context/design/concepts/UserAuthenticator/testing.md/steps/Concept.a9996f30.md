# Concept: UserAuthentication

## Concept Specification

```markdown
__concept:__ UserAuthentication [User]
__purpose:__ Limit access of an application to known and authenticated users.
__principle:__ after a user registers with a username and a password,
they can authenticate with that same username and password
and be treated each time as the same user.
__state:__
>   - a set of Users with
        - a username String
        - a hashedPassword String  (securely stored hash of the password)
        - a salt String            (cryptographically random salt used for hashing)
__actions:__
    - __register__ (username: String, password: String): (user: User) | (error: String)
        - requires: The provided `username` must not already be taken.
        - effects: A new User is created. The provided `password` is securely salted and hashed using best cryptographic practices. Both the resulting hash and the generated salt are stored in the concept's state. The ID of the newly registered user is returned. If the username is already taken, an error is returned.
    - __authenticate__ (username: String, password: String): (user: User) | (error: String)
        - requires: A user with the given `username` must exist in the system.
        - effects: The provided `password` is salted with the stored salt corresponding to the given `username` and then hashed. If the resulting hash exactly matches the stored `hashedPassword` for that user, the ID of the authenticated user is returned. Otherwise, an authentication error is returned (using a generic message to prevent username enumeration).
