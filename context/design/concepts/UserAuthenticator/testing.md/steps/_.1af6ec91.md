## Trace: Principle Fulfillment

To fulfill the principle: "after a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated each time as the same user", the following sequence of actions and state observations are traced:

1. **Action: `concept.register({ username: "principleUser", password: "principlePassword123" })`**
   * **Input:** A new unique username and a password.
   * **Effect (Expected):** The `register` action successfully creates a new user entry in the `UserAuthentication` concept's state. It returns a result object containing a `user` ID (e.g., `{ user: "user:xyz123" }`). Internally, a unique salt is generated, the password is hashed with this salt, and both the hash and salt are stored alongside the username and user ID.
   * **Observation:** We assert that the `registerResult` object contains a `user` key and that its value (`userId`) is present and of type `ID`. We also query the database directly (`concept.users.findOne`) to confirm that a user document matching this `userId` exists, and it contains the `username`, `hashedPassword`, and `salt` fields.

2. **Action: `concept.authenticate({ username: "principleUser", password: "principlePassword123" })`**
   * **Input:** The same username and password used during registration.
   * **Effect (Expected):** The `authenticate` action looks up the user by `username`, retrieves the stored `salt`, re-hashes the provided `password` with this `salt`, and compares the resulting hash using a timing-safe method. If the hashes match, it returns a result object containing the authenticated `user` ID (e.g., `{ user: "user:xyz123" }`).
   * **Observation:** We assert that the `authResult` object contains a `user` key and that its value is identical to the `userId` obtained from the registration step. This confirms that the user is successfully authenticated and recognized as the same entity that was registered.
