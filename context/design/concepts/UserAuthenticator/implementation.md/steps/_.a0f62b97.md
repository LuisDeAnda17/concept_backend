# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

```
__concept:__ UserAuthentication
__purpose:__ Limit access of account to known users
__principle:__ after a user registers with a username and a password,
they can authenticate with that same username and password
and be treated each time as the same user
__state:__
>   - a set of Users with
        - a username String
        - a password String
__actions:__
    - __register__ (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
        - requires: A username and password of which neither has been taken before
        - effects: A new User is created with the same username and password
    - __authenticate__ (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
        - requires: the username and password both correspond to the same, existing User
        - effects: The User is allowed to enter
```
