# response:

Here are the synchronizations for the `BrontoBoard` concept, all in one TypeScript file (`src/syncs/brontoboard.sync.ts`). These syncs handle various requests, ensure proper authorization via `Sessioning`, and manage the BrontoBoard's actions and queries.

First, let's assume the `BrontoBoardConcept` has been updated with a couple of additional queries to make the syncs cleaner for fetching specific assignments and office hours by their ID. I'll include these small additions for clarity.
