# prompt: Why ... ?
# response:

To answer that, I need a little more information!

Please tell me **what** you'd like to ask "why" about.

For example, you could ask:

*   "Why is the sky blue?"
*   "Why did the Roman Empire fall?"
*   "Why do we dream?"
*   "Why is it important to recycle?"
*   "Why did the chicken cross the road?" (though that one's a classic joke!)

Once you fill in the blanks, I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive answer!
